# YouTube Control Fix

![Promo Image](promo_images/440x280.png)

The YouTube UI has a different action for the arrow keys depending on if you last selected the video, track bar, or volume with your mouse. This extension catches those keystrokes and reverses the action the UI takes, then sends fake keystrokes to the video element so that arrow keys have a consistent action.
